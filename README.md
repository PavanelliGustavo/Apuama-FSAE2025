# Apuama-FSAE2025
In this repository, I will discuss and analyze information from the Apuama Racing team at the 21st Formula SAE Brazil competition.

Formula SAE is a student engineering competition organized by SAE International (Society of Automotive Engineers). The main objective is to challenge engineering students to design, build, and test a formula-type race car, applying theoretical knowledge in a practical context. The competition involves static and dynamic tests, evaluating everything from design and costs to the vehicle's performance on the track.

Apuama Racing is the Formula SAE team from the University of Bras√≠lia, which has been participating in the competition since 2011. Our results have improved over the last four years, and this is a general analysis of the competition during that period:
