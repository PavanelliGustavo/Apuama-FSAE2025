# Apuama-FSAE2025
In this repository, I will discuss and analyze information from the Apuama Racing team at the 21st Formula SAE Brazil competition.

Formula SAE is a student engineering competition organized by SAE International (Society of Automotive Engineers). The main objective is to challenge engineering students to design, build, and test a formula-type race car, applying theoretical knowledge in a practical context. The competition involves static and dynamic tests, evaluating everything from design and costs to the vehicle's performance on the track.
