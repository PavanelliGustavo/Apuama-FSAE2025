There is no point in having a good car if you don't have a good strategy, so in this section, I will discuss what we should consider in order to achieve the best possible ranking.

The competition consists of static and dynamic events, with the dynamic events only taking place after the team has obtained permission in the static events, which may require some revisions. Given this, if approval is delayed, the team may not have time to complete all the dynamic tests, creating the need to prioritize stages that add more value to the final result.

**General Static:**

| Category    | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Presentation| 75     |
| Cost        | 100    |
| Design      | 150    |
| **Total**   | **325**|

**General Dynamic:**

| Category     | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| Acceleration | 100    |
| Skid Pad     | 75     |
| Autocross    | 125    |
| Efficiency   | 100    |
| Endurance    | 275    |
| **Total**    | **675**|

Knowing the score for each event and that we need to accumulate as many points as possible, the simplest line of reasoning, and also the one currently adopted, would be to participate first in the stages with the highest added value. Of course, other factors affect this decision, such as the waiting time in line to take the test, but what the history of the last four years shows is that there is a preference for tests with higher scores.

But I noticed something looking at the results of Formula SAE 2025: despite having a higher maximum score, several teams do not even come close to this result, which leads us to reflect: could it be easier to achieve a certain score in a race, even if it has a shorter interval than others?
